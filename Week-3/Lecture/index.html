    <h1>Design Systems Notes 9/7/2021</h1>
    <h2>how to design an aesthetically pleasing site</h2>
    <p>Figma is a cross between adobe illustrator and adobe xd</p>
    <p>Design system: a collection of reusable parts that can be assembled to build
    an application</p>
    <p>They're like legos, you start with base blocks and work up</p>
    <h2>atomic design</h2>
    <p>atom -> molecule -> organism -> template</p>
    <h3>Some examples</h3>
    <p>Uber https://www.figma.com/community/file/805195278314519508</p>
    <p>Slack https://www.figma.com/community/file/769284130491933817</p>
    <p>Establishes brand consistency. Duplicate it to study it more.</p>
    <h2>design system covers all</h2>
    <p>includes pattern library, which is more focused than entire design system</p>
    <h1>Part 2: Web Design 101</h1>
    <h2>color</h2>
    <p>online always using RGB, which is additive color mixing</p>
    <p>subtractive color mixing, cmyk, is for ink</p>
    <p>always use RGB for web so it matches</p>
    <p>RGB optimized for screens 0 to 255</p>
    <p>CMYK optimized for print</p>
    <p>hex value is another way of representing RGB</p>
    <p>all three colors in full in additive will get white</p>
    <h2>styling</h2>
    <p>trending colors come from brands</p>
    <p>the bigger the organization, the longer it takes for them to catch up to the trends</p>
    <h2>color theory</h2>
    <p>building a color scheme</p>
    <p>some colors work well together</p>
    <p>look for inspiration for color palletes from artists or nature</p>
    <p>like van gogh (really nice color pallete)</p>
    <h3>monochromatic</h3>
    <p>easiest color pallete, hard to mess up</p>
    <p>start with neutrals then go to different shades</p>
    <p>would work well for a clothing website since you're very image focused</p>
    <p>facebook good example of monochromatic because everything is blue, because content is the focus </p>
    <h3>complementary</h3>
    <p>hardest to pull off</p>
    <p>across each other on the color wheel</p>
    <p>low saturation dark colors to give warm feeling, but high contrast</p>
    <h3>triadic</h3>
    <p>triangle</p>
    <p>difficult to pull off</p>
    <h3>analogous</h3>
    <p>same side of the color wheel</p>
    <p>easier to pull off</p>
    <h3>split complementary</h3>
    <p>mixing complementary and analogous colors</p>
    <p>spotify uses gradient as accent color</p>
    <hr>
    <p>what's your neutral, what's your base, what's your accent</p>
    <p>universal colors of red, orange, and green</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>typeface</h2>
    <p>names like arial</p>
    <h2>font</h2>
    <p>weight of your typeface</p>
    <h2>hierarchy</h2>
    <p>can be by size, or by weight</p>
    <p>or go simple, use size to go by hierachy</p>
    <p>a challenge could be different way of stylings like weight and italics</p>
    <h2>font mixing</h2>
    <p>opposites attract: serif and sans-serif</p>
    <p>go borrow other people's stuff</p>
    <p>use your inspector tool to figure out which font people use</p>

    <h2>pattern library</h2>
    <p>homework</p>
    <p>border is the line, what you want that to look like</p>
