      <p>index.html is really just a text file</p>

      <p id="second">Use lorem ipsum to help with styling filler text</p>
      <p>Responsive font sizes help so the font size for a 4K screen vs an ipad
      makes sense. It's not one size fits all.</p>
      <p>Using !important in your css will override the other styles, but that's a
        dangerous path to go down. <span id="sit">Useful if</span> working with an established stylesheet,
        but avoid if possible.</p>

      <p class="grey">Learning about classes. Good for if you want a certain thing to be a certain color throughout the site, based on the class tag</p>

      <p>span is for inline styling of text that's other than bold/italics</p>
      <p>Classes are bits of stylings that you want to reuse again and again (like navigation). A subset of styling. Ex: ID is something you would use a single time, which isn't super common in web development. More often than not, you'll make it a class.</p>
