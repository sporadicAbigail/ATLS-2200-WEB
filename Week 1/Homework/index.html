  <h1> Here are some things about me </h1>

  <h2> Goals </h2>
  <p>Overall, I want to <em>learn.</em> <s>I didn't really know much going into
    this course.</s> But properly learning HTML sounds like a good extra
    bit of knowledge as well. The part where we create our own website is interesting.
    I've been wanting to create an "about me" page for my social
    media. But I did not want to use carrd since it seems so
    limiting and time consuming. I know writing my own website
    will be even more time consuming, but it looks like it'd be fun plus I
    won't be limited. </p>

  <h2> Description of me </h2>
  <p> I'm a 3rd year chemical engineering student taking a minor
    in CTD. I'm a commuter student and am commuting from Broomfield.
    My current laptop is an old machine that is hanging onto life
    by a thread. I have plans to get a new one, but until then,
    every day is a bit of a gamble. I'm doing CTD to have something
    fun in my course schedule, and because my hobbies involve many
    CTD related things, mainly, motion graphic design. Plus, coding
    is fun.</p>
