    <h2>What is web accessibility?</h2>
    <p>accessibility guidelines</p>
    <p>Accessibility makes more money</p>
    <p>Native html 5 is already accessible, but the moment you do custom things, you need to make it more accessible</p>
    <p>Websites aren't accessible because they want to do more things and end up making it less accessible.</p>
    <h2>Who is web accessibility for?</h2>
    <p>Everyone</p>
    <p>Like captions - people where english isn't their first language, for hard of hearing, etc.</p>
    <h3>Things to code for</h3>
    <h4>Auditory</h4>
    <p>People who are hard of hearing and require captions/transcript. like captions on videos (a youtube video)</p>
    <h4>Cognitie</h4>
    <p>Difficulty focusing. deliver content in more than one way, like a blog has text + images + video</p>
    <p>don't have an entire block of text</p>
    <h4>neurological</h4>
    <p>avoid flashing lights</p>
    <h4>physical</h4>
    <p>not everyone will use a mouse or keyboard or a stick, so make it as easy as possible.</p>
    <h4>speech</h4>
    <p>some websites require you to interact with a website verbally, but try not to do that</p>
    <h4>Visual</h4>
    <p>people who are blind or colorblind or nearsighted.</p>
    <p>they use screenreader</p>
    <h2>We are coding for People</h2>
    <h2>Web content accessibility guidelines</h2>
    <p>perceivable - perceive it through another sense</p>
    <p>operable - operate with both a mouse and a keyboard</p>
    <p>understandable - understood by a range of people</p>
    <p>robust - works across multiple platforms, and it needs to continue to work into the futre as technology evolves</p>
    <h2>Website grades</h2>
    <p>A: some issues must be resolved and represents significant barriers</p>
    <p>AA: generally accepted</p>
    <p>AAA: very few websites are this level, some issues could be resolved</p>
    <p>Check the color contrast - are the color contrast good?</p>
    <h2>Code with accessibility in mind</h2>
    <p>webpage title</p>
    <p>website semantic: headings structure, navigation. We know section, H1-H6, we need headers in each section. Navigation can have a navbar with list. as long as you have semantics, it should be easier to navigate. test if your website would work the same with or without css. Would you understand it the same?</p>
    <p>Links: descriptive -> 'Read more' vs 'Climate Change Full Story'</p>
    <p>Alt test: image description, <i>if the image was removed, would the user still get all the information from the page?</i> The only time when your alt text would be empty is if it were decorative, like a logo. It should be neither the title of your image nor an essay. Enough that you know what the photo is above.</p>
    <h2>WAI-ARIA</h2>
    <p>Accessible rich internet applications</p>
    <p>Helps developers create widgets, applications, and web interactive in general that meet WCAG recommendations</p>
    <p>it's just super helpful for accessibility</p>
    <p>aria attributes to add to make anything you want accessible</p>
    <h2>Design with accessibility in mind</h2>
    <p>Color contrast so it's easy to read at any font size. Contrast is different between 40px and 12px</p>
    <p>Text wrapping: make sure you don't have to scroll horizontally and vertically to read text. It's annoying to have to scroll back and forth horizontally. If you can make it so your text wraps, that helps everyone. Especially for slow readers as well. Responsive design helps with that.</p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>WAVE - you can add to google chrome</p>
    <p>Lighthouse - similar to WAVE but more</p>
    <p>JAWS - job access with speech, but it costs $95</p>
    <h2>FIGMA</h2>
    <p>Install a plugin for a11y color contrast checker</p>
    <h2>Make technology work well for people with disabilities. Include everyone, including those with disabilities.</h2>
