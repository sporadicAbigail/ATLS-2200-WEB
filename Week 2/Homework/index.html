      <h2>What is a youtaite?</h2>
      <p>A hobby where people from around the world collaborate to make a cover
      of a song. It requires the collaboration of people who sing, who can mix,
      make the video, and make some kind of art (sometimes). This is entirely a
      hobby and can be <s>aggravating</s> frustrating as projects get abandoned
      or fall through due to people ghosting or
      to poor leadership. The age range of participants is usually from middle school to
      people in their late 20's.</p>

      <p><em>It boils down to "weeb karaoke."</em></p>

      <h2>Chorus Battles</h2>
      <p>Several people will compete in <b>chorus battles</b> which are competitions
      where the same type of collaboration happens on a time crunch whilst competing
      against other teams.</p>

      is one entry by the team Princessia Petals. Unfortunately, they haven't
      released their entry for round 2, despite continuing to the next round.</p>
